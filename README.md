# Boilerplate

A starting point for Vue-based projects, incorporating a number of customisations to the base Vue scaffold that I have come to prefer, including:

- Extensive eslint configuration
- Additional aliases in Vite
- Customised Tailwind configuration and starter CSS
- Custom Vitest and Cypress configuration
- Custom Vitest and Cypress commands to simplify the component mounting process
- `simple-git-hooks` integration
- Removed unused files
- Updated .gitignore
